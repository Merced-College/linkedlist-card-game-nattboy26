# Lab: Linked List Card Game

## What Did We Add?
We added a simple game of War. First we started by adding a way to shuffle the deck before the game starts. You win by getting the higher card value. All you have to do to play is run the code and follow the prompts in the terminal.

## What Part Uses The Linked List?
The parts that use the Linked List are the deck after shuffling, and also the player hands, which we added in case we wanted to do a more complex game.
